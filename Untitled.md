Hi Laurel,

On Wednesday, March 14th I had my "Final Round" of interviews for the Technical Editor position. 
I had a great time speaking with with Etel, Brian, and Justin and I am thrilled at the possibility of joining the team.
I didn't think I could be any more enthusiastic about working at DO  after the first interview - but I was wrong. 

After learning more about the role, I'm positive that my years of relevant work experience, educational background, extensive technical knowledge, and strong passion for Linux and Open-Source technologies make me a perfect fit for the Technical Editor position.

I cannot imagine a job I'd be better suited for and I can assure that I would meet or exceed all expectations for this position. I hope that I portrayed this to the team during the interview process.

I have put together a list of relevant professional references, and I wrote two brand new DO tutorials, so please let me know if thereâ€™s anything else I can provide to assist in the decision-making process.

When I should expect to hear back with my next steps?

I eagerly await your response and hope to hear from you soon!

Thanks in advance,
Greg Myers
