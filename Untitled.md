Hi Laurel,

On Wednesday, March 14th I had my "Final Round" of interviews for the Technical Editor position. 
I had a great time speaking with with Etel, Brian, and Justin and I am thrilled at the possibility of joining the team.
I didn't think I could be any more enthusiastic about working at DO  after the first interview - but I was wrong.

I cannot imagine a job I'd be better suited for and I can assure that I would meet or exceed all expectations for this position.

What should I expect after my interviews?Your recruiter will reach out to discuss your interview, your concerns, and any further questionsyou might have. Your recruiter will also outline the next steps in the process so we are all on thesame page. Our interview teams will typically round-up within 48 hours of your interview, so youcan expect an update following.

I have a long list of relevant professional references, and I wrote two brand new DO tutorials, so please let me know if thereâ€™s anything else I can provide to assist in the decision-making process.

When can I expect to hear back regarding my next steps?

All the best,
Greg Myers
