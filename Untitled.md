Hi Laurel,

This past Wednesday, I interviewed with Etel, Brian, and Justin during my Final Interviews.

I had a great time talking with Etel, Brian, and Justin during my interviews this past Wednesday and I'm thrilled at the possibility of joining the DigitalOcean team.
I didn’t think I could be any more enthusiastic about working at DO  after the first interview - but I was wrong. 

I cannot imagine a job I'd be better suited for and I feel it would be deeply rewarding to serve both DigitalOcean and the community at large would be a dream come true.

Years of relevant work experience, educational background, and extensive knowledge of Linux and Open Source technologies, am the perfect candidate for the job. Even more so, my passion for learning and sharing 
My passion for learning and sharing information, combined with my love Linux and Open Source software 

I have a long list of relevant professional references, and I wrote two brand new DO tutorials, so please let me know if there’s anything else I can provide to assist in the decision-making process.

When can I expect to hear back regarding my next steps?

All the best,

Greg Myers
